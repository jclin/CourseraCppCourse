# About

This repository contains my implementations for the homework assignments of the [C++ For C Programmers, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-a/home/welcome) class.

## Honor Code

I worked hard on these assignments, and expect you will respect Coursera's Honor Code. I take no responsibility if you are caught blatantly copying the code in this repository. Please come up with your own solution for these assignments. Finally, my solutions may not actually be correct so violate the Honor Code at your own peril - you've been warned ;-)
